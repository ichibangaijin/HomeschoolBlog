The most ridiculously awesome competition in the history of ever happened March 12, 2017 at Hackingtons in Rocklin. 

## World Water Bottle Flipping Championships
-----
Water bottle flipping is extremely annoying and has been banned by most middle schools. But sometimes in life, you have to celebrate ridiculousness. 

Yes, we had real trophies. It was a free event with all ages invited, both Hackingtons and Non-Hackingtons students participated. Even moms got out there and learned to bottle flip. With about 20 active participants the competition heated up quickly. 

Max jumped out to an early lead with 13 flips in a row. An incredible feat considering most of us teachers can barely get one. Carson quickly came in and tied up the race. These two would go back and forth until Zy came in. After about 10 minutes of warming up he took off on a streak to land 26 flips in a row! Both Carson and Max quickly rallied to get 21 but Zy put on a clinic landing 38 in a row by the end of the day. Carson and Max both could not break past that 21 mark. 
All of this was happening while the other students were breaking their own personal records! With encouragement from the teachers and help from other students, the Hackingtons way, they continued to push their limits and become flipping masters. The mood was so infectious even the parents were joining in!

We see this a lot with Hackingtons students, they bring home their enthusiasm for coding and end up teaching their parents everything the learned.

Now back to the competition. As time comes closer and closer to the end the tie between Max and Carson just can not be broken. The competition ends, Zy is the clear winner with 38 consecutive flips. However second place is up for grabs, we need a tie breaker. A flip off!

Matt Highland, the founder of Hackingtons, and even grand marshal puts 2 minutes on the clock, the most flips in that time winds. For the first minute it is neck and neck. Carson lands a flip, Max lands a flip until the fatigue of the event takes effect and Max stumbles, misses a few flips and Carson seizes the opportunity and pulls ahead. With the momentum Carson lands over 50 total flips in the alloted time Max closed in but was not quite able to recover, though he put forth a valiant effort.

The final standings: 

# First Place: Zy
# Second Place: Carson
# Third Place: Max


Was this the greatest event in the history of the world?  Possibly.



# Happy Coding!
