### Warning: Pixelmon is not for beginners.

If this is your first time learning about Minecraft, I would suggest starting somewhere much easier.  Pixelmon is a modification package to the standard Minecraft, and it is somewhat difficult to install for beginners.  

###  How to install Pixelmon.  Watch this, it's important.

###  You will need to increase the memory to decrease lag in Pixelmon.

Your computer memory for Minecraft is usually set up with 1gb and 128mb.  This is fine for normal Minecraft, but super laggy in Pixelmon.
Hopefully your computer has an extra 2gb of RAM available.  Following the picture below to increase Minecraft RAM to 2gb and 256mb.  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ev7AatHhiQ" target="_blank">If its too confusing, here is a YouTube video explaining the entire process.</a>
