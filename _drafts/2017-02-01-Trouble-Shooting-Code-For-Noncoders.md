We know it is intimidating to try and help your student with their code if you have never coded before. If you see some red or pink on the coding page there are errors. These 5 tips will help you trouble shoot code even as a non-coder. It's easier than you think! 

## Trouble Shooting Code for Non-Coders
-----

### Tip #1: Check the Spelling
Often the simplest and quickest fix is just to check the spelling on the page. Pay close attention to what is inside the "< >" symbols. These are called tags and they tell the website how to draw the elements on the screen. If the spelling is not correct it may look funny. The most common mistake is writing <code><h1></h1></code> as <code><hi></hi></code>. They look very similar and it is an easy mistake to make if you are coding for the first time. <code><hi></hi></code> is not a tag and will not work properly. This same process can be applied to all code. Just check that the spelling matches the spelling in the video. 

To go along with this make sure there are spaces where they need to be. The most common one to see is inside the img tag <code><img src="imageName.png" width="300"></code>. Students often forget the space before the word width. This is key to the code funcitoning.

### Tip #2: Make Sure Each Bracket has a Matching Bracket 


### Tip #3: Make Sure File Names are Accurate


### Tip #4: Check for Tags Inside Tags


### Tip #5: Check Where the Files are Stored


### Bonus Tip: Post the code to the Help! Forum on app.hackingtons.com


# Happy Coding!
