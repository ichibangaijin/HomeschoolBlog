The most ridiculously awesome competition in the history of ever happened March 12, 2017 at Hackingtons in Rocklin. 

## World Water Bottle Flipping Championships
-----
Water bottle flipping is extremely annoying and has been banned by most middle schools. But sometimes in life, you have to celebrate ridiculousness. 

Yes, we had real trophies. It was a free event with all ages invited, both Hackingtons and Non-Hackingtons students participated. Even moms got out there and learned to bottle flip. With about 20 active participants the competition heated up quickly. 

Was this the greatest event in the history of the world?  Possibly.
