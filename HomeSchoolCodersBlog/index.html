        <p>Hackingtons, the popular Silicon Valley based code school for kids, has officially launched Hackingtons Online!<br><br>

At Hackingtons we offer a unique project based coding experience. We focus on Web and Game development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Thatâ€™s right, we teach how to build video games using the most popular scripting language on the web JavaScript.<br><br>

Our students can launch their projects live to the web starting from the very first day and show them off on the Hackingtons Showcase for hundreds of kids and parents to see. <br><br>

And all of this is available online, to those of us who live just a bit too far to come into class, or those home school coders that need to access it from anywhere in the world. <br><br>

We have even adapted the in-class teaching experience for an online environment. Offering our online coders the ability to speak directly to a teacher through the questions forum and Hackingtons Live.<br><br>

All an online coder needs is a computer that will run Google Chrome, Mac and Windows both work.<br><br>
