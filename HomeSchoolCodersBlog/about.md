I believe that learning to code is a far more useful skill than simply playing video games. I think there are a lot of concerned parents looking for alternative programs to supplement their child's love of technology. I know, because I am one of them. Creating Hackingtons is my gift to both my son and other parents out there, looking for an incredible gift to give their child.

As an experienced public elementary school teacher, I know that school teachers have a difficult challenge trying to meet all of the core standards. I built Hackingtons as an extension of your child's education. I like structured programs, that start from zero and move towards hero.

Hackingtons is authentic. Everything we do is real and nothing is sugar-coated. We are serious about making a difference in the world.

I built Hackingtons from what I visualized to be the perfect learning environment: a combination of small class size, community, collaboration, real world projects, resulting in real world job skills. The kids come here for coding skills, but they leave here with a mini-business degree and an entrepreneurial spirit.
